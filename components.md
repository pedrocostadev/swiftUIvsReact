## Components vs Views

In both SwiftUI and React, developers define the user interface using components, which are modular and reusable
pieces of code that represent a specific part of the UI. These components can be composed together in various ways to
create complex and dynamic user interfaces.


### React

```javascript

import React from 'react';

const SomeComponent = () => (
    <div>
        <p>This is a react component</p>
    </div>
)

```

### SwiftUI

```swift

import SwiftUI

struct SwiftUIView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
    }
}

```
