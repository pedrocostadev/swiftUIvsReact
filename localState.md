## Local State

### React

```javascript

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Name = () => {
    
    const [name, setName] = useState('')

    return (
        <label>
            Name
            <input
                name="name"
                value={name}
                onChange={ev => setName(ev.target.value)}
            />
        </label>
    )
}

```

### Swift

```swift

import SwiftUI

struct SwiftUIView: View {

    @State private var name = ""

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Name", text: $name)
    }
}

```

@State should be used with simple struct types such as String, Int, and arrays, and generally shouldnâ€™t be shared with other views. If you want to share values across views, you should probably use @StateObject ensuring that all views will be refreshed when the data changes.
